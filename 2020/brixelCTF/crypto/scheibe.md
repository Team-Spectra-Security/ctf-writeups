## Solution

Did some search about german cryptography and I found the German "**Enigma**" cipher that was used by the Nazi during World War II.

Using Cryptii's Enigma Decoder, I manged to get the flag using the settings that was given on the challenge description.

since they said the the flag is just one word, and doesn't need to be the translated.

the flag is `brixelCTF{sauerkraut}`
